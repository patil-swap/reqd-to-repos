# Reqd to Repos

**Reqd to Repos** is a public project series where I turn job responsibilities into quick, one-week builds. Every project is tightly scoped to reflect a specific skill or responsibility mentioned in real job postings — turning vague job requirements into working code, fast.

This repo is part of a *create-in-public* journey to improve my dev skills, build relevant portfolio pieces, and (let’s be honest) give hiring managers fewer excuses.

## 🧠 The Idea

> *"We’re looking for someone who writes clean code, understands APIs, builds responsive UIs..."*  
Cool. I’ll just show you.

Each subfolder inside this repo is a standalone project inspired by a specific job requirement or responsibility.

## 📂 Projects

Each folder below is a standalone project built in 1 week, inspired directly by job descriptions.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Most job descriptions are vague. They throw buzzwords like “clean code,” “responsive UIs,” “collaborate with cross-functional teams,” but never show what that *actually* looks like. So instead of just tweaking my resume to match, I’m building real projects that bring those bullet points to life.

**This series exists because:**

* I got tired of being told I “need more relevant experience” — this *is* relevant experience.
* Tutorials teach you concepts, but job postings want *results*. So I reverse-engineer the requirements and build something usable.
* I wanted a way to keep improving my skills *without disappearing into another 30-hour Udemy course*.
* It’s easy to write “proficient in React and Redux” on LinkedIn. It’s harder to ship something that proves it in a week. That’s what this does.
* And yeah — it’s also a jab at job postings that want 4 years of experience for a junior role. I’m showing how much you can do in *one week*.
